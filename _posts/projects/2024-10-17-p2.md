excerpt: Create a package that can be reused with the item it contains.
---
### Description
You and (potentially) a partner will work on a sustainable package design together. There are two goals to accomplish with the design of the packaging. The first is to minimize the materials used and the waste created in the construction of the package. The second is to design a container that can be reused in some way that is relevant to the item it is containing. You will also create a visual identity and design for the packaging.

Three rules in the design of the packaging:
- No part of the packaging goes to waste
- Not allowed to use any existing/found containers or branding
- Must use at least one tool from The MIX

#### Things to Keep in Mind
* What information should be on the package?
* Does the container reuse need instructions?
* How to create a cohesive design with three different items
* Craft is just as important as the design
* The unboxing and reassembly experience

#### Objectives
* Craft skills â€“ cutting, folding, taping, gluing
* Working in 2-D and 3-D
* Branding as it relates to package design
* Creating digital mockups
* Working with a partner

#### Checkpoints
* <span class="due">10/24/24_#1</span> &ndash; two ideas for item and package reuse, names for each, reference imagery
* <span class="due">10/31/24_#2</span> &ndash; 10 sketches for logos and at least two rough sketches for package and secondary use
* <span class="due">11/07/24_#3</span> &ndash; two digital logos, two digital surface designs, low fidelity prototype
* <span class="due">11/14/24_#4</span> &ndash; final dieline/cut files, refined surface design, refined prototype
* <span class="due">11/21/24_#5</span> &ndash; initial digital mockups, high fidelity prototype
* <span class="due">11/28/24_#6</span> &ndash; flex week
* <span class="due">12/05/24_FINAL</span> &ndash; final submission due

#### Requirements
* Name for product
* Consistent visual brand
* Package is reusable for item
* Packaging uses one tool from The MIX

#### Final Submission
* Turned in on time (12/5/24)
* Physical package with designs on it
* Digital mockups
* PDFs of dieline and/or cut files
* Images of physical package
* All images and pdfs on Canvas
* All images on Figma
* All requirements met
