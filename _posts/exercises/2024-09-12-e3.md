#### Exercise 3: MYOD
Together with a partner, pick one of your containers from E2 and create a label design for it. To do this you will need to create a dieline to wrap the container in, create a design for the dieline, and then print and glue it to the container. The design on the dieline should include the name of the item (real or fictional) and any other supporting information to help sell the product.

##### Things to Keep in Mind
* The material you are wrapping has a thickness
* Consider how the dieline folds when designing
* There is no required information on the package other than the name but that doesn’t mean there cannot be other information

##### Objectives
* Craft skills – cutting, folding, taping, gluing
* Creating a dieline
* Beginning to consider branding as it relates to package design
* Relationship building

##### Requirements
* Physical package wrapped with your design
* Name of object on design
* Image(s) of package and pdf of dieline with design uploaded to Canvas added to Figma
