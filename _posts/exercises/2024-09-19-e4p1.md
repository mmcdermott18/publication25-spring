#### Exercise 4: Pair of Plants (Part 1)
In Tinkercad, design a holder for a small succulent that will be 3-D printed. The container should not exceed 4” in any dimension, have an opening at least 2” in each direction, and at least one small drainage hole. It also needs to be able to sit on a flat surface without falling or rolling over.

##### Things to Keep in Mind
* What possibilities does 3-D printing open up for designing objects?
* The opening needs to be wide enough and deep enough for the succulent to sit in but must have a bottom
* Think about color but don’t get too set on on

##### Objectives
* Learn 3-D printing and design
* Working within size limitations
* Learning Tinkercad

##### Requirements
* 3–D printed succulent container
* Opening at least 2" in all directions
* Container does not exceed 4" in any one dimension
* At least one small drainage hole
* Image(s) on Canvas and Figma
